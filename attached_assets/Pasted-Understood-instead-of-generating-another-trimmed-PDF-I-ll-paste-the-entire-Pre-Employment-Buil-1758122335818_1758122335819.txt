Understood 👍 — instead of generating another trimmed PDF, I’ll paste the entire Pre-Employment Build Pack v1.1 (Handover Edition) here in full detail so you can copy it directly to Roylett.

📂 GPNet Pre-Employment Build Pack v1.1 — Handover Edition

(Locked – Sept 17, 2025 • Brand Colour: Teal #00A68C)

⸻

Handover Context

This document is the definitive specification for building the GPNet Pre-Employment Check process.
It includes technical and operational details plus handover notes for developers (Roylett/Replit) and non-technical stakeholders.
Please treat this pack as the single source of truth for Phase 1 (Pre-Employment only).

Scope
   •   Build only the Pre-Employment Check process.
   •   Other case types (Injury, Prevention, General Health, Mental Health, Exit) are out of scope.

Deliverables
   •   A working Pre-Employment workflow integrated with Freshdesk ticketing.
   •   Fit Classification logic and RAG scoring implemented.
   •   Employer-ready PDF report generation and email delivery.
   •   Data storage and threading rules enforced.

⸻

Executive Summary (non-technical)

Most employers struggle to manage health risks before hiring. Small issues missed at pre-employment often lead to costly WorkCover claims later.

GPNet automates this step:
	1.	Candidates complete a health form.
	2.	The system analyses their responses.
	3.	Employers receive a clear report with Fit Classification and recommendations.

Everything is stored in Freshdesk tickets, ensuring a full audit trail.
This document specifies how the process works, how data flows, and how success will be measured.

1. Executive Summary & Scope
   •   GPNet is a case-management hub for employers, workers, doctors, and insurers.
   •   This build pack covers only the Pre-Employment Check process.

In Scope:
   •   Worker form capture (via Jotform).
   •   Automatic Freshdesk ticket creation & email threading.
   •   Automated analysis → Fit Classification & recommendations.
   •   Consultant review → employer report delivery.
   •   RAG scoring for flagged risks.
   •   Email subject line standard applied to all messages.

Out of Scope (Phase 1):
   •   Injury, Prevention, General Health, Mental Health, Exit workflows.
   •   Manager dashboards beyond report view.
   •   Payment plans, billing, multi-tenant analytics.

⸻

2. Glossary
   •   Case: A worker-specific workflow instance (here: Pre-Employment Check).
   •   Ticket: Canonical container for a case (ID, emails, notes, attachments, events).
   •   Agent: Manager-facing assistant suggesting next steps, drafting correspondence.
   •   RAG: Red/Amber/Green risk score used for prioritisation.

⸻

3. Roles & Permissions
   •   Employer Manager: View case status, final report, receive notifications.
   •   GPNet Consultant: Review analysis, edit recommendations, approve report.
   •   System Admin: Configure users, permissions, templates, integrations.
   •   Worker (External): Submit form only.

⸻

4. End-to-End Workflow (Pre-Employment)

Swimlane Steps:
	1.	Worker → submits form (Jotform).
	2.	System → creates Freshdesk ticket (subject per standard), attaches payload (JSON + PDF).
	3.	System → analyses responses; computes Fit Classification & RAG; drafts recommendations.
	4.	Consultant → reviews & edits as needed; approves.
	5.	System → generates PDF report; emails employer; stores report in ticket; updates status to Complete.

Status Codes: NEW, ANALYSING, AWAITING_REVIEW, REVISIONS_REQUIRED, READY_TO_SEND, COMPLETE.

⸻

5. Form Specification (Fields & Validation)

Sections & Fields:
   •   Worker Details: first_name*, last_name*, DOB*, phone*, email*, role_applied*, site/location.
   •   Medical History: previous_injuries (textarea), conditions (multi-select), medications, allergies.
   •   Musculoskeletal: back, neck, shoulders, elbows, wrists/hands, hips, knees, ankles/feet (none/current/past + details if non-none).
   •   Functional Capacity: lifting (kg), standing (mins), walking (mins), repetitive tasks (yes/no + details).
   •   Psychosocial Screening: sleep (1–5), stress (1–5), support (1–5), comments.
   •   Consent & Declaration: consent_to_share*, signature*, date*.

Validation Rules:
   •   All * fields required.
   •   If any body part ≠ “none” → require details (≥10 chars).
   •   Lifting <10kg or repetitive tasks = yes → flag Amber.
   •   DOB must make age ≥15.

⸻

6. Fit Classification Logic
   •   Fit without restriction: no issues, functional thresholds met, RAG=Green.
   •   Fit with restrictions: minor issues/reduced capacity → specify limits.
   •   Not fit: significant issues, unsafe → recommend GP/physio clearance.

⸻

7. RAG Scoring Logic
   •   Green: no issues, functional capacity matches role, psychosocial ≤3/5.
   •   Amber: 1–2 minor issues or borderline functional shortfall.
   •   Red: multiple issues, severe shortfall, or clearance required.
