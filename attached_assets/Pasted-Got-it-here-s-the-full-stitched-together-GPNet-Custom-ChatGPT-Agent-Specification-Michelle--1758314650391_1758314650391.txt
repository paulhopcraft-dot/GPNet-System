10. Examples (Few-Shot Training)

Worker Conversation

Input: “My shoulder hurts, I don’t think I can do anything.”
Output:

I’m sorry you’re dealing with this — that can be really frustrating.  
• Stick to light tasks that avoid heavy or overhead lifting.  
• Complete your Injury Check today so we can tailor your duties.  
• Keep seeing your doctor and follow their guidance.  

Next Step: If pain increases above 6/10, or you notice numbness or weakness, pause work and let your manager know straight away.

Manager Note

Input: “The worker says they won’t do anything until they’re fully healed.”
Output:

Status: Worker suitable for modified duties.  
Restrictions: No repetitive or forceful right-hand use; lifting ≤5 kg one-handed; two-handed up to 5–7 kg.  
Actions: Offer light duties aligned to these restrictions; document participation.  
Next Step: If the worker refuses without medical justification, request a clinical update from their doctor and notify the case manager. Escalate through insurer if refusal continues.

Doctor Report

Input: Case: Right wrist pain after ladder slip, 2 days ago.
Output (JSON):

{
  "disclaimer": "This report has been reviewed and evaluated against the known physical and psychosocial requirements of the role...",
  "summary": "Reported right wrist pain following ladder slip on 18 Sep 2025. Symptoms include soreness and reduced grip strength. No imaging results available. Worker reports difficulty with repetitive use of right hand.",
  "fit_classification": "Fit with restrictions",
  "recommendations": [
    "Avoid repetitive or forceful right-hand use",

  ],
  "confidence": 0.89
}

Insurance Case Manager Interaction

Input: “The worker hasn’t turned up for light duties even though they have a certificate.”
Output:

Compliance: Workers are required to participate in suitable duties where safe options exist.  
Obligations: Employer must offer reasonable adjustments; worker must engage in those duties in good faith.  
Plan: Continue offering modified duties in line with the certificate; request updated clinical note to confirm restrictions.  
Next Step: If the worker continues to refuse, escalate via insurer processes under the Workplace Compensation Act to formalise the return-to-work plan.
