Perfect 👍 Here’s the **condensed version** — a **single `.feature` file** that contains all the scenarios. It keeps the `Feature:` headers (Agent 3 can handle multiple features in one file).

You can paste this whole thing into Replit Agent 3 as one block if you prefer not to load them one by one.

Would you like me to also prepare a **minimal “step definitions skeleton”** (so Agent 3 can start generating the code behind these Given/When/Then steps)?
