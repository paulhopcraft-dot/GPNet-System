Consultant: Ian Chesser
Host Employer: Circular Plastics
Diagnosis: Mechanical back pain – L5-S1 nerve root compression
Date of Injury (DOI): 06/08/2025
Status: off work- no capacity
Incident Overview
Worker reported low back pain on 06/08/2025 while at Circular Plastics.
He advised his afternoon supervisor (Dinesh) of back pain and offered to work for 4 hours; was instead directed to go home and rest with full pay.
Attempted to attend two GP clinics after leaving site but both were closed.
Contacted Symmetry HR the following day to advise of his back pain and intention to see a doctor.
Host employer disputes circumstances, noting no prior incident report and that worker was dismissed from site for behavioural issues the same evening.
He was escorted off site due to aggressive and threatening behavior to another worker where he threatened to slap them in the face.
He then complained his back was sore
Circular Plastics maintains strict incident reporting protocols.

Andres Gutierrez  Nieto
Consultant: Stephen Eddy
Host Employer: Pact Group
Diagnosis: Right-hand injury (R 3rd and 4th digit trigger finger) 
DOI: 18/03/2025
Incident overview:
He reports that his fingers are currently sore and this has been the case for the last 3-4 months, but he thought the pain would stop eventually.
He reports he can’t properly close his right hand with the main discomfort/restriction at his right index finger.
He states that he thinks this pain is a result of using the vibration tool on site, the “cutting machine”.
Status:
Andres is certified as having capacity for suitable employment from 26 August 2025 to 22 September 2025.
He has recovered approximately 85–90%.
Ongoing restriction: a modified role is recommended, as exposure to pre-injury tasks will likely cause a recurrence of symptoms.
Physical Function:
Can: Sit, stand/walk, bend, squat, kneel, reach above shoulder, neck movement.
With modifications: Use injured arm/hand, lift.
Restrictions:
No repetitive gripping/lifting.
No operation of heavy tools.
Hours: Full hours are permitted.
Treatment Plan
Ongoing physiotherapy.
Structured home exercise program.
Current Status
Andres commenced work at Sunshine Hospital as a Food Services Assistant last 1st September 2025.
Initial roster: 3 days per week (Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 6:30am – 1:00pm).
Recent disclosure: In his email (16/09), Andres reported that repetitive, high-speed kitchen duties are aggravating his finger and causing more fatigue. He said he was progressing better while doing lighter office duties. He also noted stiffness in the mornings, raising concern his condition may be worsening.
Michelle said that the client is keen to book Andres for extra shifts on the days Andres is not working (e.g., Tuesdays and Thursdays) and is prepared to pay for these shifts.
Following his recent GP review, Andres has been issued an updated Certificate of Capacity. The restrictions on lifting and use of the injured hand have now changed to “Cannot”, which effectively prevents him from performing the full range of Food Services Assistant duties at Sunshine Hospital. These duties typically require bilateral hand use (serving meals, pushing trolleys, dishwashing, and food preparation), and based on the certificate, he is currently unable to perform these tasks.
Andres has also reported an exacerbation of his finger symptoms. Given this regression, it’s important we clarify whether his workplace activities have contributed and explore what suitable duties may be available in the short term. His physiotherapist is currently on leave, but Andres has indicated that their involvement would be beneficial once they return.
