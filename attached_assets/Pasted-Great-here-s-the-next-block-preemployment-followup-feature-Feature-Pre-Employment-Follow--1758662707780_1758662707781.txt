Feature: Pre-Employment Follow-up – Michelle Doctor Mode & Probation rule
  As a manager
  I want to consult Michelle and escalate to a doctor on concerns
  So that I receive timely medical guidance and policy-aligned recommendations
  Note: If any step does not behave as described, the application must be corrected to comply.

  Background:
    Given environment "staging"
    And employer "Symmetry HR" exists
    And I am logged in as manager "Andrew Bailey" with role "Employer"
    And a pre-employment report for "John Smith" exists with outcome "Concerns present"

  @preemployment @michelle @dialogue
  Scenario: Manager consults Michelle; escalate to real doctor if stuck
    When I open the pre-employment review and ask Michelle for guidance
    Then Michelle enters "Doctor Mode" and provides structured guidance (no final opinion)
    When I provide questions for a doctor
    Then an escalation task "Medical Opinion Request" is created and linked with transcript
    And if any of these steps fail, the system must be corrected.

  @preemployment @sla @opinion
  Scenario: 30-minute medical opinion SLA and email delivery
    Given a "Medical Opinion Request" escalation exists
    When the medical opinion is prepared
    Then the opinion is emailed to the manager within "30 minutes"
    And the link opens the recommendation view with a decision disclaimer and a suggestion to schedule a Prevention Check before probation
    And the case status updates to "Reviewed (Medical Opinion)"
    And if any of these steps fail, the system must be corrected.

  @preemployment @policy
  Scenario: Organisation must define a probation period
    When I open Employer Settings and attempt to enable pre-employment recommendations without a probation period
    Then I am blocked with a validation: "Set a probation period to proceed."
    When I set "Probation Period" to "90 days" and save
    Then the setting is stored and referenced by pre-employment flows
    And if any of these steps fail, the system must be corrected.
