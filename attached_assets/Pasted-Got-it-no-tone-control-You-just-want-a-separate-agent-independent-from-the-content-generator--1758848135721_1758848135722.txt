Got it — no tone control. You just want a separate agent (independent from the content generator).

Here’s a clean, minimal split that works great:

Two-Agent Setup
	1.	Content Agent (generator)

	•	Job: create today’s LinkedIn draft (topic → hook → 5-line body → CTA).
	•	Inputs: your settings (niche, themes), optional prompt.
	•	Output: raw draft object {id, content, meta}.

	2.	Inbox Agent (separate, no tone)

	•	Job: be the delivery + scheduling + interaction brain for your personal inbox (your web app).
	•	Responsibilities:
	•	Run the 09:00 schedule (calls the Content Agent).
	•	Save drafts to DB and mark status (draft | approved).
	•	Push a browser notification / update the UI feed.
	•	Handle user actions: More like this, Approve, Copy, Archive.
	•	(Optional) Dedupe check against last 7 days.

This keeps “what to write” (Content Agent) separate from “when/where/how it shows up to you” (Inbox Agent).

How the flow works
	•	09:00 → Inbox Agent triggers → calls Content Agent → stores result.
	•	Your browser app calls /api/today (served by Inbox Agent) → shows draft.
	•	You click Approve / More like this → Inbox Agent performs the action (may call Content Agent again for a new draft).

Minimal endpoints (owned by Inbox Agent)
	•	GET /api/today → latest draft for you.
	•	POST /api/more → asks Content Agent for another variant; stores & returns it.
	•	POST /api/approve → marks post approved.
	•	POST /api/archive → archives a draft.
	•	POST /api/cron/generate → secured route; Inbox Agent calls Content Agent and saves.

Tiny data model

posts: id, user_id, created_at, status, content, meta
settings: user_id, niche, themes[], post_time, timezone

Why this is good
	•	Modular: You can swap the Content Agent later without touching delivery.
	•	Stable: Inbox Agent owns persistence, scheduling, notifications, and UI hooks.
	•	Extensible: Later you can add other generators (Twitter Agent, Article Agent) and the same Inbox Agent will deliver them to the same web inbox.

If you want, I can draft the exact TypeScript stubs for:
	•	agents/contentAgent.ts (generate)
	•	agents/inboxAgent.ts (schedule + API handlers)
	•	pages/api/* (today, more, approve, cron)

So you can paste into Replit and run.
