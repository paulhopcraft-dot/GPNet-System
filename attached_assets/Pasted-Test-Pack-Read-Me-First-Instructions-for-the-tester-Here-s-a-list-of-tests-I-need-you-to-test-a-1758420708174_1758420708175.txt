Test Pack — Read Me First

Instructions for the tester:
Here’s a list of tests. I need you to test all of these and make sure they’re all working and give me a report. For each item:
	1.	perform the steps implied, 2) mark Pass / Fail, 3) attach evidence (screenshot/URL/log ID), 4) note defects with clear repro steps. Use the “Report Template” at the end.

Acceptance Test Checklist (GPNet / StaySure + Michelle)

Platform-wide
	•	ENV setup (Dev/Stage/Prod isolation; configs swap without code edits).
	•	User roles (Admin, Client Owner, Consultant, Manager, Recruiter, Worker, Read-only) — least-privilege enforced.
	•	Auth (email+password, SSO optional, token refresh, forced logout).

Admin (multi-tenant)
	•	Create tenant (branding, defaults; unique slug visible).
	•	Impersonation (banner + full audit trail).
	•	Archive / Unarchive (nothing deleted; full restore works).
	•	Global Michelle (cross-tenant, redacts client PHI appropriately).

Data model & governance
	•	Case schema (Pre-Employment, Injury, Prevention, New Starter, Exit, Mental Health) — CRUD + history.
	•	Attachments (virus scan, preview, searchable metadata).
	•	Audit trail (who/what/when/before→after; exportable CSV).

Client onboarding
	•	Org profile (sites, managers, roles, WorkCover fields).
	•	Branding (logo/colors/sender reflected in emails/WhatsApp).

Permissions & privacy
	•	Scope enforcement (tenant and site scoping; cross-tenant calls rejected with 403).
	•	PHI masking (only permitted roles see sensitive fields; notifications redact).

Michelle (conversation engine)
	•	Always proposes next step (0 dead-end turns across varied cases).
	•	Case-aware tone/flow; uses “reported/perceived” language.
	•	Channel delivery (WhatsApp primary, SMS, Email) — delivery + reply ingestion.
	•	Email link check-in (signed, single-use token).

Check types (flows & logic)
	•	Pre-Employment (≤10 min median, ≥95% completion).
	•	Injury Check (incident → symptoms → management → status → risks; Fit Classification set).
	•	Prevention Check (risks/ergonomics; default Fit = “Fit without restriction”).
	•	New Starter (early risk signals; “monitor only” tagging for minor notes).
	•	Exit Check (simple flow; feedback feeds ROI dashboard).
	•	Mental Health (psychosocial screen; crisis phrases trigger human handover).

Fit Classification & templates
	•	Single-selection ticks: Fit w/out restriction / with restrictions / Not fit.
	•	Standard disclaimer present verbatim in all reports.
	•	Seven fixed sections after Recommendations (for Injury/Prevention/New Starter); template lint passes.

Escalation & stakeholders
	•	Manager workflow (correct site-mapped manager; replies ingested).
	•	Doctor loop (request clinical note; triage call scheduled; summary logged).
	•	Insurer/WorkCover fields required only when WorkCover flag set.

Cadence & scheduling
	•	Severity-based cadence (High q2w, Moderate monthly, Low every 2 months) auto-schedules and updates on severity change.
	•	Missed check-ins → two reminders → escalate to manager with timestamps.

Integrations
	•	Freshdesk sync (case↔ticket, comments/attachments two-way in <60s).
	•	Airtable/DB (workers, sites, cadence, scores; referential integrity).
	•	JobAdder (stub) 50→10 shortlist dry-run with sandbox data.
	•	Stripe billing ($29/mo; grace window; lock when unpaid).

Notifications & deliverability
	•	Email DKIM/SPF/DMARC pass; no spoof warnings in Gmail/Outlook.
	•	WhatsApp/SMS opt-in captured; fallback to email on failure; delivery receipts stored.

Analytics & ROI (SureGrand)
	•	Attrition baseline vs managed (per recruiter, host, portfolio) — reconciles with raw events.
	•	“Off-track only” alerts (low alert fatigue).
	•	Staysure Insights exit-reason trendlines visible.

Ratings & matching
	•	Candidate 1–5 star rating (host + recruiter; weighted).
	•	“Available soon” high-rating notifications trigger correctly.
	•	Confidential host score visible only to recruitment company roles.

Reporting & exports
	•	PDF reports (branded, paginated, accessible; checksum/versioning).
	•	Tenant data export (CSV/JSON) respects role scope; PHI redaction where required.

Security & compliance
	•	Secrets in vault (e.g., Freshdesk API Key) — rotate without downtime.
	•	Access logs (geo/IP/device, impersonation, exports) searchable.
	•	Privacy/consent captured; regional storage options; DSR workflow within SLA.

Reliability & fail-safes
	•	Retries/backoff + idempotency for webhooks/email/SMS/WA; chaos test shows no dupes.
	•	Human handover available; playbooks used; median handover <5 min in support hours.
	•	Backups/DR: RPO ≤15 min, RTO ≤1 hr; quarterly fire-drill restore validated.

Performance & UX
	•	P95 TTI <3s desktop, <4s mobile; RUM + synthetic pass.
	•	Mobile-first responsive flows (iOS/Android smoke tests).
	•	Accessibility WCAG 2.1 AA (axe ≥95).

Observability
	•	Logs/metrics/traces correlated by case; one-minute clickthrough from case → events.
	•	Error budgets & burn alerts; 30-day SLO compliance visible.

ML governance (if enabled)
	•	XGBoost + feature store versioned; instant rollback/A-B toggle.
	•	SHAP explanations load <1s P80; top drivers shown.
	•	Drift/bias monitors with thresholds and alerts.

Content & wording guarantees
	•	Liability language check (auto-lint for “reported/perceived”).
	•	Disclaimer string match test across all report types.

Timezone & locality
	•	TZ handling: Asia/Manila user vs AU clients; UI shows local time, storage in UTC; calendar invites correct.

Testing & simulation
	•	Seed scenarios: long absence; modified duties; online medical certificate; workplace accident; WorkCover vs non-WorkCover; non-participation → terminal outcomes (full duties / modified duties / exit).
	•	2,000-run harness with ≥90% branch coverage across flows.

Documentation & help
	•	Runbooks cover top incidents with step-by-step fixes.
	•	In-app contextual help (<2 clicks to relevant article).

If you want this as a spreadsheet or Airtable import (columns already set), say so and I’ll output a ready-to-use CSV.
